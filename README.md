## 🎨 My Portfolio

This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer. Since this is my first time building a portfolio, I can’t guarantee perfection — but it represents an important milestone in my learning journey. I'm excited to continue improving and growing as a developer, and this portfolio serves as a strong foundation for my future work.

### 🧰 Built With

#### **HTML5**

* A button element that uses the `href` attribute to download a file.
* Text elements that open a new browser tab when clicked — linking to external resources.

#### **CSS**

* Hover effects in the project section.

  * When a user hovers over a project `div`, a hidden `div` (like a popup or overlay) is revealed for more information.

#### **JavaScript**

* A `switch-case` function to manually control the visibility of `div` containers.

  * When a user clicks a project or button, the corresponding `div` is displayed, and all others are hidden.
* `scrollIntoView()` is used to smoothly scroll to different sections of the page when a navigation menu item is clicked.
